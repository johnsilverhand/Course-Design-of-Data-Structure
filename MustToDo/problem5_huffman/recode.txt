When you are old and grey and full of sleep 
And nodding by the fire take down this book 
And slowly read and think of the soft look
Your eyes had once and of their shadows deep;
How many loved your moments of glad grace 
And loved your beauty with love false or true 
But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you 
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;
And bending down beside the glowing bars 
Murmur a little sadly how Love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars 
William Butler Yeats
To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hou
William Blake

National debate in the United States on the role played by race in college admissions culminated with the Supreme Court hearing challenges against two universities 

To create a diverse student body many colleges and universities in the US consider a student s race as a factor in their admissions process  Such race-conscious policies known as affirmative action have been repeatedly upheld by the nation s top court in past decades 

Educators fear a ripple effect if the conservative court decides that the affirmative action policy is illegal 

The baseline for permissible affirmative action programs in US higher education was established in  X X X X 

Citing Harvard University as the model Justice Lewis Powell said that in evaluating applicants race could not be the determinative factor but the university could use race as one of the many factors just as it uses other traits such as a special talent for music science or athletics and even the fact that an applicant s parents attended the university 

In  X  X X the Supreme Court upheld an admissions program at the University of Texas at Austin ruling that the university could continue to consider race as a factor 

This time the challenges were brought against Harvard and the University of North Carolina or UNC with the court hearing the arguments in late October 

The new Supreme Court is the most conservative for  X  years  The six justices appointed by Republican presidents and the three appointed by Democrats appeared divided along ideological lines 

The court is likely to overturn some or all of such case precedents based on sharp and skeptical questioning from the conservative justices 

During court argument Justice Clarence Thomas asked lawyers for the universities to define diversity   He said It seems to mean everything for everyone  Justice Samuel A Alito Jr  asked what underrepresented minority meant 

The justices are not expected to finalize their opinions until late June or early July  If they rule that affirmative action is unconstitutional the number of black and Latino students would be reduced in colleges and universities nationwide particularly at elite institutions 
Affirmative action is a government policy designed to help minorities and disadvantaged groups find employment gain admission to universities and obtain housing 

Race-conscious policies aim to address discrimination that denies underrepresented students access to higher education 

Until the  X X X s and  X X X s Harvard and UNC refused to admit large numbers of black students and other students of color  Both schools said affirmative action allows them to select a diverse student body to create an inclusive educational environment that benefits all students 

However opponents of affirmative action targeted the universities arguing that their programs violate equal protection principles and discriminate against Asian American students 

Students for Fair Admissions or SFFA a conservative group that brought both challenges to the Supreme Court sued Harvard and UNC in  X  X X 

The group alleged that Harvard intentionally discriminated against Asian American applicants by holding them to a higher standard in undergraduate admissions and specifically limiting the number of Asian Americans it admits each year 

While Harvard is a private university the plaintiff said the institution was violating the  X X X X Civil Rights Act that prohibits schools receiving federal funds from discriminating based on race 

In the UNC case the group said the school policy is subject to the same law as well as the  X Xth Amendment s guarantee of equal protection which covers state universities  It said the school discriminated against white and Asian applicants by giving preference to black Hispanic and Native American students 

SSFA lawyer Patrick Strawbridge accused UNC of using race behind opaque procedures in awarding mammoth racial preferences to African Americans and Hispanics 

 A white out-of-state male who had only a  X  percent chance of admission would have a  X X percent chance if UNC treated him as an African American and a  X X percent chance if it treated him as a Hispanic he said 

In contrast to Strawbridge s suggestion US District Judge Loretta C  Biggs found that the university continues to face challenges admitting and enrolling underrepresented minorities particularly African American males Hispanics and Native Americans  

In October last year she ruled in favor of UNC saying it had not shown illegal bias against white and Asian American students 

The university has been struggling to build a diverse student population  In a state that is  X X percent black just  X percent of the undergraduate student population is African American 

Biggs wrote in her ruling Ensuring that our public institutions of higher learning are open and available to all segments of our citizenry (is) an institutional obligation  

SSFA filed an appeal at an appeals court in Richmond Virginia and at the Supreme Court  In January the Supreme Court decided to hear the challenge even though the appeals court has not yet ruled 

The lawsuit brought against Harvard by SSFA centers on the treatment of Asian American students who have on average better standardized test scores and grades than any other ethnic group including whites 

Harvard admissions consider a student s academic extracurricular athletic and personal ratings  The latter category attempts to assess how an applicant impacts people around him or her and the contributions the student might make 

SFFA accused Harvard of discriminating against Asian American students by using a subjective standard to gauge traits such as likability courage and kindness 

In  X  X X the district court ruled in favor of Harvard finding that it did not discriminate against Asian Americans  In November  X  X  an appellate court affirmed the district court decision ruling that it did not clearly err in finding that Harvard did not intentionally discriminate against Asian Americans  

Harvard denied the accusation saying that Asian American enrollments have consistently risen  The university s lead lawyer Seth Waxman said during the Supreme Court argument that if the school abandoned consideration of race as a factor representation of African American and Hispanic students in admissions - not white students - would decline 

The  X  X X Asian American Voter Survey found that  X X percent of Asian American voters favor affirmative action programs designed to help black people other minorities and women gain better access to higher education 

Among Chinese Americans support for affirmative action stands at  X X percent the lowest within the Asian American community 

A Chinese American lawyer in Silicon Valley California said he opposes affirmative action because it is outdated 

 A long time has passed since affirmative action was created  We don t need it anymore said the father of two who requested anonymity  He said he fears that his children now in middle school will be disadvantaged when applying for college 

Chinese for Affirmative Action an organization based in San Francisco has been trying to persuade the Chinese community that the discrimination it faces is not the result of affirmative action 

Instead of focusing on affirmative action the activists called for opponents to question other areas of the admissions process such as legacy admissions and athletic preferences 

According to the National Bureau of Economic Research  X X percent of white students admitted to Harvard fall under the categories of recruited athletes legacy students and children of faculty and staff members  This percentage also includes the dean s interest list which consists of applicants whose parents or relatives have made donations to the university
